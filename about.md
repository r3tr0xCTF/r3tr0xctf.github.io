About ME!!!

Welcome to my corner of the cybersecurity universe! I'm a cybersecurity professional passionate about bridging the gap between offensive and defensive security, with a particular focus on the often-overlooked world of Operational Technology (OT) environments.

What I Do:

My primary expertise lies in purple teaming, where I work to strengthen organizations by combining red team attack techniques with blue team defensive strategies. There's something uniquely rewarding about not just finding vulnerabilities, but helping teams understand how to detect and respond to them effectively.

OT Security is where much of my focus lies these days. Industrial control systems, PLC networks, and critical infrastructure present fascinating security challenges that are quite different from traditional IT environments. The stakes are often higher, the systems more complex, and the attack vectors constantly evolving.

Beyond my day job, I'm actively involved in:

Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions - nothing beats the thrill of solving a well-crafted challenge
Bug Bounty hunting - I'm relatively new to this space but finding it an excellent way to sharpen practical skills
Threat Intelligence research - understanding adversary tactics and staying ahead of emerging threats

Why This Blog?

The cybersecurity field moves fast, and knowledge sharing is crucial for all of us to stay current and effective. My goal is to create content that serves multiple audiences:

Students and newcomers will find beginner-friendly explanations and learning resources

### More Information

I believe in making complex topics accessible without dumbing them down. Whether you're just starting your security journey or you're a veteran looking for fresh perspectives, there should be something here for you.

Cybersecurity is fundamentally a community effort. I encourage questions, discussions, and different viewpoints. Feel free to reach out if something resonates with you, if you disagree with an analysis, or if there's a topic you'd like to see covered.
The threat landscape evolves constantly, and so should our approaches to defending against it. Let's learn and grow together.
